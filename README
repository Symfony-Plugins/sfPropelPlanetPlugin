powered application.

== Installation ==
The plugin and its dependecies can be installed using two methods, SVN or PEAR.

=== SVN install ===
Edit the `svn:externals` property to the `plugins` directory of your symfony
project and add these lines if they don't exist yet:

{{{
sfFeed2Plugin http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfFeed2Plugin/
sfWebBrowser http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfWebBrowserPlugin/
sfPropelActAsSluggableBehaviorPlugin http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfPropelActAsSluggableBehaviorPlugin/
sfPropelPlanetPlugin http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfPropelPlanetPlugin/trunk
}}}

Then run the `svn update` command. 

== PEAR install ==
Run the following commands within a bash prompt at the root of your symfony project:

{{{
$ php symfony plugin-install -s beta sfPropelPlanetPlugin
}}}

Dependencies will be installed automatically.

== After plugin(s) has been installed ==
Run these commands within your project:

{{{
$ php symfony cache:clear
$ php symfony propel:build-all-load <appname>
}}}

Where `<appname>` is the name of one of your existing apps.

== Configuration ==
There's pretty nothing to configure except by adding some customization to your 
`app.yml` file. A bundled self-explanatory `app.yml` is provided to help 
yourself seeing what can be configured.

== Usage ==
The plugin is bundled with two dedicated task and web modules. 

Tasks can be used with from the command line interface, and you can schedule 
them using the *nix [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron CRON] utility.

Web modules provides quick'n'dirty frontend and backend rough web interfaces to
display and manage your data.

=== Using the `planet:feed-add` task ===
The `planet:feed-add` allows you to add and grab a new feed to your planet. Here
is a sample call:
{{{
$ php symfony planet:feed-add http://feeds.feedburner.com/symfony/blog
}}}

Where the url is the feed url you want to add to your planet. This command will 
fetch its entries, and store them in your database.

To get help on available options, just type:
{{{
$ php symfony help planet:feed-add
}}}

=== Using the `planet:feed-grab` task ===
The `planet:grab-entries` updates perempted feed entries, I mean the ones which
the `periodicity` value has been exceeded. 

To launch the task, just run the following command:
{{{
$ php symfony planet:feed-grab
}}}

To get help on available options, just type:
{{{
$ php symfony help planet:feed-grab
}}}

=== Using bundled web modules ===
The web modules provides somewhat useful frontend and backend interfaces.

==== The `sfPlanetAdmin` web module ====
The `sfPlanetAdmin` module provides admin features of your feeds entries. From
there you can add, edit, delete and list available feeds in your planet. To 
enable the module for an application, edit its `settings.yml` file as following:

{{{
all:
  .settings
    enabled_modules: [default, sfPlanetAdmin]
}}}

Then eventually purge your application cache and browse to `/sfPlanetAdmin`. 

==== The `sfPlanet` web module ====
The `sfPlanet` module provides list of feed entries as HTML or RSS output. To 
enable the module for an application, edit its `settings.yml` file as following:

{{{
all:
  .settings
    enabled_modules: [default, sfPlanet]
}}}

Then purge your application config cache with `php symfony cc` and browse to 
`/planet/home/1.html` after having added some feeds to your planet.

Pagination is handled automatically, but configurable in the `app.yml` file.

Note that the plugin provided bundled symfony routes:
 * `sf_planet_home`: The home of the planet, listing entries from all active 
   feeds
 * `sf_planet_feed_home`: The list of all entries for a given feed, passing its 
   mandatory `slug` parameter

An RSS feed for the planet is also available. Just point your browser at 
`/planet/home/1.rss` and enjoy. You can even paginate yout planet feed browsing
at `/planet/home/2.rss`, `/planet/home/3.rss` and so on.
